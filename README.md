# InOutParsimony
Implementation of the InOutParsimony algorithm for solving the Small Gain-Loss Phylogeny problem

The jupyter notebook InOutParsimony.ipynb allows to use the InOutParsimony algorithm to solve the Small Gain-Loss Phylogeny problem. The program takes as input a synteny tree (in newick format), a dictionnary mapping each synteny to a synteny content and costs for gain and loss events.
